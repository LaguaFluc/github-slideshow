# Your GitHub Learning Lab Repository for Introducing GitHub

Welcome to **your** repository for your GitHub Learning Lab course. This repository will be used during the different activities that I will be guiding you through. See a word you don't understand? We've included an emoji 📖 next to some key terms. Click on it to see its definition.

Oh! I haven't introduced myself...

I'm the GitHub Learning Lab bot and I'm here to help guide you in your journey to learn and master the various topics covered in this course. I will be using Issue and Pull Request comments to communicate with you. In fact, I already added an issue for you to check out.

I'll meet you over there, can't wait to get started!

第一次开始学习github，还是蛮兴奋的，想想我也快要变成我以前崇拜的那些很厉害的人，就觉得特别的激动，学习时动力满满呀！
加油，熬过这开始的困难时期，美好的生活（多样的资源）就在之后等待着你啦！
